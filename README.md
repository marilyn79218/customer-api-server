This is a very basic sample of how to *create*, *update*, *delete* and *get data* form **mongoDB** with **Node.js**

# How to use
  - to start the server with function get data list and display 
      ```
      node monjadeserver.js 
      ```
  - to create new data
    ```
    node moncreate.js 
    ```
  - to update existed data
    ```
    node monupdate.js
    ```
  - to delete specific data
    ```
    node mondelete.js
    ```

>P.S  You need to install a mongo service either in your machine 
      or connect to the server elsewhere, be sure to change the 
      **connection string** before you go.
